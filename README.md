# video-speed-changer

A Chrome extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to speed up and slow down video playback.

## How to use

1. Load a website with a video player (e.g. YouTube)
2. Start playing the video
3. Press ']' to speed up the video
4. Press '[' to slow down the video
5. Press '=' to reset the video speed to 1x

## Caveats

Sometimes if you click elsewhere on the page while a video is playing, the shortcut keys may stop working. In most cases clicking on the video to pause and play it again will fix this.
